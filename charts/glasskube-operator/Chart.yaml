description: >
  The Glasskube Operator is an open source Kubernetes operator that aims to simplify the deployment and maintenance of
  various popular open source tools. Each tool is represented by a new Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) and
  most user-facing configuration parameters are available via that CRD. Our philosophy is to emphasize ease-of-use and
  strong defaults over rich configuration. Our configurations are designed to cover as many use-cases as possible with
  minimal user configuration.
